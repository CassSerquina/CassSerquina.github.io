	<p><strong>Creative Statement</strong></p>
	<p> My work delves into the idea of storytelling, the ability to create works of art that convey a narrative. Mainly focusing on the ability of being able to convey the character's feelings to even the character's motivation through a still image. Most of my artworks are inspired from various forms of concept art ranging from video games, animation to ui and character designs. Through the digital medium I aim to create a piece of art that feels like a piece of a bigger and more laid out narrative. I invite viewers to imagine what it might be like to live as that character and what that character might be experiencing before or even after the moment captured.</p>
