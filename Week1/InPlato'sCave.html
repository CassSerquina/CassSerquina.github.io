 <h1>In Plato's Cave</h1>
 <hr>
 <p>Photography is a well known form of art and expression today, but it was never seen that way up until recently. Since the rise of industrialism cameras and photos have been widely accessible to the larger audience allowing many pictures and images to be circulated across the internet. Susan Sontag delves into the idea that photographs give us a new understanding of our world as described as a “cave”. Photographs do not simply capture certain instances that happen but instead influence our values and give us a sense of power, as Sontag states it “Alters and enlarges our notions of what is worth looking at”. I first discovered the art of photography through social media like many others have. Instagram reels, youtube shorts, or any other short form media content around the internet is filled with a wide range of photos depicting environments or an instance in time. I never really delved into the art of photography and always have taken photos simply to capture a moment I don't wish to forget. But I can always appreciate a well composited image that captures how that person views a place or instance. The ability to provide and show an emotion through an image is something I always respected. One point Sontag makes regarding the relationship between photography and humans is that it's often a “voyeuristic relation to the world”. I very much agree with this as with how easy and accessible it is to take a photo many people would rather capture that moment in time rather than relishing in it. My parents are very much like this as during a trip to the Philippines, the constant nagging of my mom and relatives to take a photo every 5 minutes really took away from the trip as a whole. I fail to understand wanting to take constant photos of your environment, I understand taking one or two at different places but when it comes to the point that you're more focused on the photos itself rather than the world it becomes detrimental to the experience. Another example can be birthdays, the constant nagging of getting a family photo with my cousins and relatives became a point of contention to both me and my cousins as we simply wanted to chat and enjoy the moment while we are forced to take a photo. Of course this is not as serious as I make it out to be but it still detracts from the overall experience especially when it's your birthday. Sontag emphasizes this nature of photography which encourages watching over participating. As a digital artist, photos of people's art have made its way onto my feed. I remember early on when I was first starting out I viewed these photos as my goal, as a form of inspiration, but as time went on and as I viewed more and more photos of people's art this inspiration turned into resentment and soon after discouragement. Sontag makes the claim that “there is an aggression implicit in every use of the camera”, while this can be interpreted as a violation of the subject being photographed, through my perspective I interpreted this as imposing standards upon people. In my case, these photos invite comparison not only limiting my creative expression due to appealing to other people, but also affecting my self worth as an artist.
