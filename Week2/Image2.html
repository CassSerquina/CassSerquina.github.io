 <h1>Image 2</h1>

<img src="/images/Image2.jpg" width="350" height="550"><br>
  <p>For Image 2 I decided to give it a more comic book approach with high contrast between both the background and the buildings. The image itself was already pretty blue so to play on that I increased its vibration and saturation in addition to making the background a high contrast red to clearly distinguish the foreground and background. I feel like this heavily contrast between subject and the background makes the image more appealing to the eye rather than simply having a sky matching the blue on the buildings.
